# CI Build Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to optimize CI/CD pipeline build times through incremental build strategies, advanced caching mechanisms, and parallel execution optimizations. The goal is to significantly reduce build times while maintaining build reliability and accuracy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Gradle Build Cache Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CI builds to reuse previously built artifacts so that build times are significantly reduced for incremental changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CI build runs THEN the system SHALL utilize Gradle build cache to reuse unchanged build outputs
2. WHEN source code changes are minimal THEN the system SHALL only rebuild affected modules and dependencies
3. WHEN dependencies haven't changed THEN the system SHALL reuse cached dependency resolution results
4. WHEN build cache is available THEN build time SHALL be reduced by at least 40% for incremental builds

### Requirement 2: Advanced Dependency Caching

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dependency downloads to be cached effectively so that network time doesn't impact every build.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are downloaded THEN the system SHALL cache them with proper cache keys based on dependency versions
2. WHEN Gradle wrapper or build scripts change THEN the system SHALL invalidate relevant cache entries
3. WHEN cache hits occur THEN dependency resolution time SHALL be under 30 seconds
4. WHEN cache misses occur THEN the system SHALL populate cache for subsequent builds

### Requirement 3: Parallel Build Execution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want builds to utilize available CPU cores effectively so that compilation time is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN builds execute THEN the system SHALL use parallel compilation with optimal worker count
2. WHEN multiple modules exist THEN the system SHALL build independent modules in parallel
3. WHEN test execution occurs THEN the system SHALL run tests in parallel where possible
4. WHEN resource constraints exist THEN the system SHALL balance parallelism with memory usage

### Requirement 4: Selective Build Execution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want only affected components to be rebuilt when changes are made so that unnecessary work is avoided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN only test files change THEN the system SHALL skip main source compilation if possible
2. WHEN only documentation changes THEN the system SHALL skip compilation entirely
3. WHEN specific modules change THEN the system SHALL only rebuild dependent modules
4. WHEN build scripts change THEN the system SHALL perform full rebuild as needed

### Requirement 5: Build Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor build performance metrics so that I can identify optimization opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN builds complete THEN the system SHALL report build time metrics and cache hit rates
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide actionable insights
3. WHEN cache effectiveness is low THEN the system SHALL suggest optimization strategies
4. WHEN builds are slower than baseline THEN the system SHALL highlight potential causes

### Requirement 6: Cache Management and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want build caches to be managed efficiently so that storage costs are controlled and cache effectiveness is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cache size exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL clean up old or unused cache entries
2. WHEN cache corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL invalidate and rebuild affected entries
3. WHEN cache hit rates are low THEN the system SHALL optimize cache key strategies
4. WHEN storage costs are high THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent cache retention policies
