# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature optimizes the GoalRepository implementation by replacing inefficient in-memory filtering with database-level queries. Currently, the repository fetches all goals from the database and filters them in memory, which creates performance issues as the dataset grows. This optimization will implement specific DAO queries for active and completed goals, improving query performance and reducing memory usage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want goal queries to be performed at the database level, so that the application performs efficiently with large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system requests active goals THEN the database SHALL return only goals where isCompleted = false
2. WHEN the system requests completed goals THEN the database SHALL return only goals where isCompleted = true
3. WHEN filtering goals by completion status THEN the system SHALL NOT load all goals into memory first
4. WHEN querying goals THEN the database query SHALL include appropriate WHERE clauses for filtering

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want goal loading to be fast and responsive, so that I can quickly view my active and completed goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading active goals THEN the query SHALL execute in O(log n) time complexity for indexed fields
2. WHEN loading completed goals THEN the query SHALL execute in O(log n) time complexity for indexed fields
3. WHEN switching between active and completed goal views THEN the response time SHALL be under 100ms for typical datasets
4. WHEN the goal dataset grows THEN the query performance SHALL remain consistent

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the repository interface to remain unchanged, so that existing code continues to work without modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing optimized queries THEN the public repository interface SHALL remain identical
2. WHEN calling getActiveGoals() THEN the method signature and return type SHALL be unchanged
3. WHEN calling getCompletedGoals() THEN the method signature and return type SHALL be unchanged
4. WHEN existing code uses the repository THEN no changes SHALL be required in calling code

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for the optimized queries, so that I can ensure the optimization works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN all existing repository tests SHALL continue to pass
2. WHEN testing active goal queries THEN the test SHALL verify only non-completed goals are returned
3. WHEN testing completed goal queries THEN the test SHALL verify only completed goals are returned
4. WHEN testing query performance THEN the test SHALL verify database-level filtering is used

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure code quality and build stability throughout the implementation, so that the optimization doesn't introduce regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing each optimization step THEN all unit tests SHALL pass without failures
2. WHEN implementing each optimization step THEN the lint analysis SHALL pass without new warnings or errors
3. WHEN implementing each optimization step THEN the debug build SHALL compile successfully
4. WHEN completing the optimization THEN the full CI pipeline SHALL pass including tests, lint, and build verification
5. WHEN running the optimized code THEN all existing functionality SHALL work identically to the previous implementation
