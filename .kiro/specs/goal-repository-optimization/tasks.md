# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Add optimized DAO query methods for goal filtering ✅

  - Create new query methods in GoalDao interface for active and completed goals
  - Implement database-level filtering using WHERE clauses instead of in-memory filtering
  - Add @Transaction methods for goals with progress data
  - Ensure proper SQLite boolean handling (0/1 for false/true)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Create comprehensive unit tests for new DAO methods ✅

  - Write unit tests to verify getActiveGoals() returns only non-completed goals
  - Write unit tests to verify getCompletedGoals() returns only completed goals
  - Test edge cases with empty datasets and mixed completion states
  - Verify Flow behavior and reactive data streams work correctly
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 3. Update GoalRepositoryImpl to use optimized DAO queries

  - Replace in-memory filtering with direct DAO method calls in getActiveGoals()
  - Replace in-memory filtering with direct DAO method calls in getCompletedGoals()
  - Maintain existing method signatures and return types for backward compatibility
  - Preserve error handling and data mapping logic
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Add unit tests for optimized repository implementation

  - Test that repository methods correctly call the new DAO methods
  - Verify domain model mapping continues to work correctly
  - Ensure existing repository test suite continues to pass
  - Add performance-focused tests to verify database-level filtering
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5.1_

- [x] 5. Run comprehensive test suite and build verification

  - Execute all existing unit tests to ensure no regressions
  - Run lint analysis to verify code quality standards
  - Build debug APK to ensure compilation success
  - Verify CI pipeline compatibility with changes
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 6. Add database index for performance optimization ✅

  - Create database migration to add index on isCompleted column
  - Update database version and migration logic
  - Test migration with existing data
  - Verify query performance improvement with indexing
  - Create comprehensive performance tests with 1000+ goal datasets
  - Test migration data preservation and index functionality
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 7. Create integration tests for end-to-end verification ✅

  - Test complete data flow from DAO to repository to domain models
  - Verify performance improvements with larger datasets
  - Test reactive data streams and Flow behavior
  - Ensure backward compatibility with existing use cases
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 4.4, 5.5_

- [x] 8. Final validation and performance benchmarking
  - Run performance comparison between old and new implementation
  - Validate memory usage improvements
  - Ensure all requirements are met and documented
  - Verify no breaking changes to public interfaces
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 5.5_
