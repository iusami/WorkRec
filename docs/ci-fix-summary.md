# CI Workflow Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. GitHub Actions Syntax Error: Unrecognized named-value 'env'

**Problem**: The workflow was trying to reference `env.GRADLE_OPTS` within the same `env` block, which is not allowed in GitHub Actions.

**Location**: Lines 225 and 285 in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Original Code**:
```yaml
env:
  GRADLE_OPTS: ${{ needs.change-detection.outputs.gradle-opts || env.GRADLE_OPTS }}
```

**Fixed Code**:
```yaml
env:
  GRADLE_OPTS: ${{ needs.change-detection.outputs.gradle-opts || '-Dorg.gradle.daemon=false -Dorg.gradle.workers.max=2' }}
```

**Explanation**: Replaced the problematic `env.GRADLE_OPTS` reference with the actual default value directly.

### 2. Deprecated save-always Warning

**Problem**: The workflow was using the deprecated `save-always: true` option in cache actions.

**Location**: Multiple cache actions throughout the workflow

**Original Code**:
```yaml
- name: Cache Gradle dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    # ... cache configuration
    save-always: true
```

**Fixed Code**:
```yaml
- name: Cache Gradle dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    # ... cache configuration
    # Removed save-always: true (deprecated)
```

**Explanation**: Removed all `save-always: true` entries as they are deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

## Jobs Affected

The following jobs were updated to fix the syntax errors:

1. **lint** job - Fixed GRADLE_OPTS environment variable reference
2. **build-debug** job - Fixed GRADLE_OPTS environment variable reference  
3. **build-release** job - Fixed GRADLE_OPTS environment variable reference
4. **test** job - Removed deprecated save-always entries
5. All jobs with caching - Removed deprecated save-always entries

## Verification

After the fixes:
- ✅ No more "Unrecognized named-value: 'env'" errors
- ✅ No more "save-always does not work as intended" warnings
- ✅ Workflow syntax is now valid
- ✅ All optimization features remain intact

## Impact

These fixes resolve the CI workflow validation errors while maintaining all the build optimization features:
- Multi-layer caching strategy
- Change detection and selective builds
- Parallel execution optimization
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Performance monitoring and metrics

The workflow should now run successfully without syntax errors.
