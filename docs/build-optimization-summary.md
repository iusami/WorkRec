## Performance Targets

### Build Time Improvements
- **Incremental builds**: 50-70% reduction
- **Dependency-only changes**: 80-90% reduction
- **Test-only changes**: 60-80% reduction
- **Documentation changes**: Near-instant (skip)

### Cache Effectiveness
- **Cache hit rate**: >80% for dependencies
- **Build cache hit rate**: >60% for incremental changes
- **Cache size**: <2GB total
- **Cleanup frequency**: Weekly automated

### Resource Optimization
- **CPU utilization**: 80-90% during parallel execution
- **Memory usage**: <4GB peak
- **Network usage**: 90% reduction in downloads
- **Storage efficiency**: Optimal cache-to-benefit ratio

## Maintenance Procedures

### Daily Monitoring
- Check dashboard for performance trends
- Review build failure rates
- Monitor cache effectiveness

### Weekly Analysis
- Run optimization recommendations script
- Review and implement suggested improvements
- Update performance baselines

### Monthly Review
- Comprehensive performance analysis
- Documentation updates
- Strategy refinement

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Integration
The optimization suite integrates seamlessly with existing GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **Automated Metrics Collection**: Build metrics are collected automatically
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Dashboard updates with each build
3. **Optimization Alerts**: Automated notifications for performance degradation
4. **Recommendation Engine**: Regular analysis and improvement suggestions

### Local Development
Developers can use the optimization tools locally:

1. **Performance Analysis**: Run optimization scripts before pushing changes
2. **Cache Management**: Monitor and optimize local build cache
3. **Configuration Tuning**: Use templates for optimal local settings

## Success Metrics
