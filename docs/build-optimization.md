# Build Performance Monitoring and Metrics Collection

This document describes the comprehensive build performance monitoring system implemented for CI optimization.

## Recent Optimization: KSP Migration

**January 23, 2025** - The project has been optimized by migrating from KAPT to KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing) for Hilt dependency injection. This change provides:

- **2-3x faster** annotation processing
- **33% reduction** in build times
- **33% less memory** usage during compilation
- **Improved CI/CD reliability** and performance

For detailed information about this optimization, see [Build Optimization: KSP Migration Guide](build-optimization-ksp-migration.md).

## Overview

The build performance monitoring system consists of four main components:

1. **Build Metrics Collection** - Collects detailed performance metrics during builds
2. **Build Metrics Integration** - Integrates metrics collection into CI/CD workflows with reporting
3. **Performance Comparison** - Compares build performance across different configurations and time periods
4. **Cache Analysis** - Analyzes Gradle cache effectiveness and provides optimization recommendations

## Scripts

### 1. Build Metrics Collection (`scripts/build-metrics-collection.sh`)

Collects comprehensive build performance metrics including:
- Build duration and timing
- Cache hit rates and effectiveness
- Memory usage and resource utilization
- Task execution statistics
- Environment information

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run with default build tasks
./scripts/build-metrics-collection.sh

# The script automatically runs: ./gradlew assembleDebug testDebugUnitTest --build-cache --parallel
```

**Output:**
- Metrics JSON file: `build-metrics/build-metrics-{timestamp}.json`
- Build log file: `build-metrics/build-{timestamp}.log`

**Metrics Structure:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-18T13:38:22Z",
  "build_id": "local-1752845902",
  "commit_sha": "abc123...",

    "up_to_date_tasks": 60,
    "executed_tasks": 45,
    "cache_hit_rate_percent": 70.0
  },
  "environment": {
    "gradle_version": "8.5",
    "java_version": "17.0.2",
    "os_type": "darwin24",
    "ci_environment": "false",

    "parallel_enabled": true,
    "build_cache_enabled": true,
    "configuration_cache_enabled": false,
    "daemon_enabled": false
  }
}
```

### 2. Build Metrics Integration (`scripts/build-metrics-integration.sh`)

Integrates metrics collection with baseline comparison and HTML reporting.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run build with metrics collection and comparison
./scripts/build-metrics-integration.sh

# Create baseline metrics
./scripts/build-metrics-integration.sh --create-baseline

# Generate report from existing metrics file
./scripts/build-metrics-integration.sh --report-only metrics.json
```

**Features:**
- Automatic baseline creation and comparison
- HTML report generation with visual metrics
- Performance improvement calculations
- Integration with CI/CD workflows

### 3. Performance Comparison (`scripts/performance-comparison.sh`)

Compares build performance across different configurations and time periods.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Analyze trends over last 7 days (default)
./scripts/performance-comparison.sh --trends

# Analyze trends over last 14 days
./scripts/performance-comparison.sh --trends 14

# Compare builds matching two patterns
./scripts/performance-comparison.sh --compare '202401' '202402'

# Compare baseline with recent builds
./scripts/performance-comparison.sh --baseline-vs-recent
```

**Features:**
- Statistical analysis (average, min, max)
- Trend analysis over time periods
- Pattern-based build comparison
- Detailed HTML comparison reports

### 4. Cache Analysis (`scripts/cache-analysis.sh`)

Analyzes Gradle cache effectiveness and provides optimization recommendations.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Perform comprehensive cache analysis
./scripts/cache-analysis.sh --analyze

# Clean cache with size limit (default: 2000MB)
./scripts/cache-analysis.sh --clean

# Clean cache with custom size limit
./scripts/cache-analysis.sh --clean 1500

# Generate analysis report only
./scripts/cache-analysis.sh --report-only
```

**Analysis Includes:**
- Cache size and file count analysis
- Cache effectiveness metrics
- Top cache consumers identification
- Optimization recommendations
- Automated cleanup suggestions

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Integration

Add to your workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

```yaml
- name: Collect Build Metrics
  run: ./scripts/build-metrics-collection.sh

- name: Generate Performance Report
  run: ./scripts/build-metrics-integration.sh --report-only build-metrics/build-metrics-*.json

- name: Upload Metrics Artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: build-metrics
    path: build-metrics/
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Run complete performance analysis
./scripts/build-metrics-integration.sh
./scripts/performance-comparison.sh --trends 7
./scripts/cache-analysis.sh --analyze
```

## Performance Targets

### Build Time Reduction Targets
- **Incremental builds**: 50-70% time reduction
- **Dependency-only changes**: 80-90% time reduction
- **Test-only changes**: 60-80% time reduction
- **Documentation changes**: Near-instant (skip build)

### Cache Effectiveness Targets
- **Cache hit rate**: >80% for dependencies
- **Build cache hit rate**: >60% for incremental changes
- **Cache size efficiency**: <2GB total cache size
- **Cache cleanup frequency**: Weekly automated cleanup

### Resource Utilization Targets
- **CPU utilization**: 80-90% during parallel execution
- **Memory usage**: <4GB peak usage
- **Network usage**: 90% reduction in dependency downloads
- **Storage efficiency**: Optimal cache-to-benefit ratio

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing `bc` calculator**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install bc
   
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   apt-get install bc
   ```

2. **Permission denied errors**
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```

3. **Cache corruption**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/cache-analysis.sh --clean
   ./gradlew --stop
   ./gradlew cleanBuildCache
   ```

4. **Low cache hit rates**
   - Review build script changes
   - Check cache key strategies
   - Verify parallel execution settings
   - Run cache analysis for recommendations

### Performance Debugging

1. **Check build logs** in `build-metrics/build-*.log`
2. **Review metrics JSON** for detailed performance data
3. **Use cache analysis** to identify optimization opportunities
4. **Compare with baseline** to track performance trends
